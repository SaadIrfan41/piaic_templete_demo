                the creation of cutting-edge AI technology. We will start this
                course by understanding the fundamentals and use cases for AI
                and move on to building next-gen intelligent apps using OpenAIâ€™s
                powerful models and Next.js 13. We'll conclude the course by
                learning about basic programming concepts using Python, such as
                lists, dictionaries, classes, functions, and loops, and practice
                writing clean and readable code with exercises for each topic.
                We'll also learn how to make your programs interactive and how
                to test your code safely before adding it to a project. It is a
                fast-paced, thorough introduction to programming with Python
                3.10+ that will have you writing programs, solving problems, and
                making things that work in no time. In this quarter we will also
                learn Git, the distributed version control system. We will also
                review Git-based GitHub services.`,

Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. In this course, you will learn how to develop cloud applications using cloud-native technologies like Containers, Kubernetes, and CDK for Kubernetes.

If you were thinking that the IoT and ambient computing sound a lot alike, you aren't wrong; the two concepts are intertwined. IoT refers to the vast array of devices that connect to the internet to optimize their functionality, like smart sensors and smart speakers: ambient computing builds on that. Ambient computing focuses on the interaction between these devices once they are connected.

Matter, the next-generation smart home standard, solves many smart home pain points while bringing all our IoT devices together. Some of the biggest tech companies are working together to make Matter a unified protocol for future smart homes. These companies include Apple, Amazon, and Google. This means Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, Google Nest, and Samsung SmartThings will support the Matter standard by default for all new devices.

In this course we will learn to build smart homes with Amazon Alexa and Matter protocol.
